## Considerations

When generating name variants, many considerations apply and may be culturally specific. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name

**Initials** may be substituted for first or middle names, and middle names may be omitted.
Example: The name "Alfred Jodocus Kwak" may appear online as any of the following equivalents:
 * Alfred Kwak
 * Alfred J. Kwak
 * AJ Kwak
 * A. J. Kwak
 * Kwak, Alfred J
 * Al Kwak

**Name order** is culturally specific: East Asian names are often written surname-givenname instead of the western style of givenname-surname, not to mention in a different character sets:
Example: Hayao Miyazaki
 * Miyazaki Hayao
 * 宮崎 駿

**Patronyms/matronyms** (names derived from the given name of a parent) may appear before, after, or in place of a surname.
Example: Abel Janszoon Tasman ("Abel, son of Jan Tasman")
 * Abel Tasman
 * Abel Janszoon

**Shortened or diminuitive** versions of a name may exist and are culturally specific.
Example: Mike for Michael, Bill for William, Bob for Robert in the West. Katya for Ekaterina in Eastern Europe.

**Marriage** may result in surname changes, hyphenation or combination of one's original name(s).

**Tussenvoegsels** in Dutch names such as "van der Laan" may be abbreviated "v.d. Laan"
